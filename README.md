# <Horiseon Marketing Agency App>

## Description

In this assignment, I refactored code for the marketing agency Horiseon. 
Following the requirements I was given, I made the webpage meet accessibility standards. I did this by using semantic HTML elements to make the code more readable, as well as ordering the elements properly so that they can be easily followed and understood. I also added accessible alt text to the image elements. The heading attributes were put into a sequential order and the title for the webpage was changed to something more descriptive. 

## Usage

Clicking on the titles located in the bar at the header will take you to that section. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
