# <Horiseon Marketing Agency application>

## Description

For this assignment, I refactored code for Horiseon, a marketing agency company. Following the requirements that I was given, I made their page meet accessibility standards by doing the following: 
I used semantic HTML  elements and organized them so that they would follow a logical structure. I also cleaned up the styling sheet by making sure there weren't any unnecessary selectors. 
I added accessible alt text to the images, made sure the headings were in order and then added a descriptive title for the page. 


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
